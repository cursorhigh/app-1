I made this web app for the web version of my earlier Python app which was an exe file so that more people can use it 
it's under development though it has some features
like
1. my own login system with email otp auth system
2. google login
3. live leaderboard which syncs to the rank of the user who has more wins
4. the game section has a partial complete game tab where we can add many games in the future and it has a chat feature so that we can chat in it


   * currently it's been removed from online access as of some security issue of the chat rooms related to encryption
